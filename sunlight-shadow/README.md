## Description

This project aims to provide tools to calculate sunlight exposure of city objects, using data in the 3DTiles format it is composed of multiple subprojects that all work together to form a coherent toolsuite.

1. [Sunlight](https://github.com/VCityTeam/Sunlight)
2. [pySunlight](https://github.com/VCityTeam/pySunlight)
3. [pySunlight-Docker](https://github.com/VCityTeam/pySunlight-docker)
4. The Sunpath calculation script described bellow, that is compatible with the aforementioned tools.
5. The technical repport that can be found in this folder.

Each projects' github repository contains its own documentation. As well as use cases and examples.
Each one is dependent on the previous project (pySunlight is dependent on Sunlight, and pySunlight-docker is a dockerised version of pySunlight).

### Sunpath calculation script

You can either run this script from the command line, or import it as a library into your project.
This tool lets you calculate the sunpath for each hour of an interval of years (ex: 1975-2025), from the point of view of a single point on eath. Described by its latitde and longitude. The result is exported in a csv file, with a format compatible with [sunlight](https://github.com/VCityTeam/Sunlight) and [pySunlight](https://github.com/VCityTeam/pySunlight).

### Requirements

* Python 3.12 or higher.
* The [pysolar](https://docs.pysolar.org/en/latest/#prerequisites-for-use) library for python.

We recommend that you use a virtual environment befor installing dependencies

```bash
python3 -m venv venv 
```

Then activate the virtual environment and install the requirements

```bash
. venv/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install -r src/requirements.txt
```

**Example :**

Calculate sunpath for Lyon between 1975 and 2075 (inclusive)

```bash
python3 src/sunpath.py --latitude 45.75 --longitude 4.85 -s 1975 -e 2075
```
